# ProjTC

Turn a fresh Arch installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern TUI system based on [Hyprland](Trocar por outro WM) by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for ProjTC (like it was for Omakub). No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. ProjTC is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.
