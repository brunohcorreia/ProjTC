# ProjTC

Turn a fresh Arch installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern(?) TUI system based on a tyling window manager by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for ProjTC (like it is for Omarchy). No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. ProjTC is an opinionated take on what TUI Linux can be.

This project is a blatant copy of 'Omarchy'; I just adapted the scripts and replaced the installed programs to better follow the TUI philosophy.
